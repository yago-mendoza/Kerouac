## General Information

This software application is a console-based, sophisticated database management tool that enables professionals to effectively manage language-related tasks. The application allows users to effortlessly create, edit, and traverse a graph structure of interconnected nodes, with each node representing a specific particle of the language[^1], such as nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and more, varying in complexity and length. In addition to particles of language, the database also includes replicas that can be used for scripting purposes.

The program's ability to seamlessly explore and modify the connections between nodes within the graph can assist writers in improving the coherence and consistency of their written content, making it more effective and impactful for their intended audience. Furthermore, the application can aid in the development of a writer's language proficiency, allowing them to refine their mastery of the language through practical experimentation with various linguistic elements.

[^1]: It should be noted that the current database used by the program is written in Spanish, but the tool itself can be applied to any language or any other ontological relational system.

### Node interconnexions

Node interconnections play a crucial role in comprehending the relationships between different particles of language. The database is designed to distinguish between synonymical connections, which represent similarities in meaning, and semantical connections, which capture direct relationships based on various factors such as usage, context, or classification. This distinction provides users with a comprehensive understanding of language relationships and a customizable environment for language-related tasks.

### Context

This project is a simplified version of Ebadgi, an more complex ongoing project encompassing SÃ¼skind, McKee and Kelsey databases. This console-based application provides access to the most fundamental functionalities while the original project continues to be developed. The repository includes the database file, which is the foundation of management and will not undergo any changes.

## Time-Saving Features

For editing the database, the tool offers a variety of commands that allow users to add, delete, and modify nodes as needed. Users can transfer data between nodes, and easily navigate the database to import specific data to a node. The tool also enables users to navigate synonyms, semantics, and notes attributes. Notes contain both definitions, examples, and additional commentaries.

In addition to editing the database, the tool enables users to consult individual nodes. By inputting the name of a node, users can view its attributes, including its synonyms, semantics, and notes. This allows users to quickly access information about specific linguistic elements without needing to navigate the entire database.

Furthermore, the tool implements a variable called BATCH that enables fast searches. With this feature, users can search for multiple nodes at once by inputting a list of node names. The tool will then output the attributes of each node in the list, making it easy to compare and analyze multiple linguistic elements at once. This feature saves users time and improves efficiency in their research and analysis.

## Installation

Assuming that you already have [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/) and [python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your system, to download all the files and folders from a GitHub repository to your local machine, you can use the `git clone` command followed by the URL of the repository. In this case, the command is:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yago-mendoza/Kerouac
```

This will create a new directory called "Kerouac" in your current working directory, which will contain all the files and folders from the repository.

Once you have cloned the repository, you can run the `console.py` file using Python. To do this, navigate to the "Kerouac" directory that was created when you cloned the repository, and then run the following command:

```python
py console.py
```

This script contains the code for the program, which allows you to interact with a database using a command-line interface, displaying the following program header.

```bash
~ KEROUAC ~
\ Find your words, express your world.

Tip : write "help" to learn more about commands.
<i> .autosave : 'False' by default
```

And Congrats ðŸŽ‰ the Application would start if you have followed each step correctly. This will allow you to easily explore and modify the linguistic graph using a variety of commands, such as "cd node," "ls node," or "remove node", further developed in the [next section](#usage). The application is designed to be user-friendly, with simple and intuitive commands that allow you to navigate and modify the graph with ease. It also includes error-handling features to prevent accidental modifications and ensure that the program runs smoothly.

## Usage

After every action, the prompt `%H.%M.%S ~ [field]@[node]/:` indicates the current node and the layer of interconnexions currently targeted, either "synonymical" or "semantical". Additionally, there is a 3rd field dedicated to "Observations" which provides a space to store custom input such as definitions, examples, or fun facts related to the node.

### Commands

#### Basic Commands
The following is a list of basic commands that can be used to navigate the database:

* `e/y/o` : switches the "attribute field" to synonyms, semantics or observations.
* `cd <title>` : sets the "current node" to a specified node.
* `r (--pinned)` : sets the "current node" to a random node.
* `cd ..` : sets the "current node" to the previous one.
* `.remove` : deletes the "current node" from the database.
* `p` : pins the "current node".
* `u` : unpins the "current node".
* `[custom text]` : associates custom text to the working "attribute field" for the "current node".
* `= <i> <i> ...` : updates the attributes for the current "attribute field" with those of the specified attribute.
* `<i> <i> ... =` : transfers the "attribute field" attributes of the "current node" to those at specified positions.
* `ls / + (sort)` : displays the set "attribute field" for the current node.

#### Batch Commands
The batch is a space for storing nodes for performing searches. The following is a list of batch commands:

* `<` : adds the "current node" to the batch.
* `< <title>` : adds a specified node to the batch.
* `> <i> <i> ...` : empties the specified nodes from the batch.
* `>>` : empties the batch completely.
* `b (sort)` : displays the batch.
* `*<n>` : effectuates a search based on at least "n" batch attributes.

#### Suggester Commands
The suggester allows for quick navigation through intelligent attributes, allowing for further study or immediate insertion:

* `s` : instantiates a suggester and accesses it.
* `''` : generates the next suggestion.
* `t` : associates the current suggestion with the "current node" through the set "attribute field".
* `cd` : sets the current suggestion to the "current node".
* `<` : adds the suggestion to the batch.
* `c` : rints out the "current node" expression.
* `ls / + (sort)` : displays the set "attribute field" for the suggestion (purely optical)
* `q` : quits suggester mode.

#### Other Commands
The following is a list of miscellaneous commands:

* `~ <title> :` finds and displays grammatically similar nodes.
* `&pinned (sort)` : displays all favorite (pinned) nodes.
* `$obs` : generates a random observation.
* `:ncol <n>` : sets the number of displaying columns to "n".
* `:autosave (0/1)` : toggles between auto-save and manual-save.
* `:details (0/1)` : toggles between showing details (number of connections) when displaying node lists or not.
* `.clear` : clears the window.
* `.extract` : saves a copy of the database to the desktop environment.
* `.save` : saves the progress so far.
* `.exit` : quits the terminal (discards any unsaved changes).

#### Attribute Displays
Before expiring (bash will report it), attribute displays (ls/+) implement the following commands:

* `cd <i>` : sets the "current node" to the specified attribute.
* `del <i> <i> ...` : deletes the specified connections.
* `ls <i>` : displays the "attribute field" for the specified attribute, streamlining navigation.
* `del` : deletes all attributes from the "attribute field" at the "current
